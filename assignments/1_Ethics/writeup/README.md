## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)
After finding the security problems in the ECU, the first thing I would do is tell my boss.  That
is not only my job but also, they deserve the opportunity to take ownership of the situation and 
handle it appropriately.  Assuming the company handles the situation and takes the time to fix 
the problems, my job is done and no one else needs to know.  Consumers were never 
affected so I have no responsibility to tell the public and consumer watchdogs have no place 
here yet.  Now if the company is unwilling to postpone the release of the ECU, the first thing I 
would do is go to my lawyer to discuss my legal options.  My decision would be to go as far as 
possible to ensure the safety of consumers because by knowing and not acting, I am 
responsible for harm that results.  Some may argue that by doing my job and reporting it, I 
need take no responsibility for what happens after.  I disagree because my knowledge of the 
issues makes me complicit in any harm that occurs.  

To be clear on how far I would I go, it depends on whether or not the ECU has released at this 
point.  If the product is already released it would be irresponsible to tell the public immediately 
because it would put those people at risk from attackers until the issues are fixed.  In this 
scenario I would be pressuring from the inside of the company.  Otherwise if the company 
fails to act responsibly against the danger, I would tell the public directly.  Even though this 
puts my career and perhaps even freedom at risk, I have a responsibility toward the safety of 
the people before my own.
